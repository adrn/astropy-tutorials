Tutorials
=========

This repository contains tutorials for the `Astropy <http://astropy.org>`_ project (also on `github <https://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_).

Contributing
============

Overview
--------

Each tutorial is essentially an `iPython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ file. The notebooks are each saved in a separate directory within the `tutorials` subdirectory in this project. Let's look in `FITS-Header <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/FITS-Header>`_ as an example. There is a single iPython notebook file that contains the text and code for the tutorial, and a FITS file used in the tutorial. The notebook file is automatically run and converted into a static HTML page (`example <http://tutorials.astropy.org/FITS-header.html>`_), which is then displayed in the tutorial listing on http://tutorials.astropy.org. Each tutorial also has a file containing metadata about the tutorial such as the author's name, month and year it was written, and any other information that should be associated with the tutorial.

Procedure
---------

_If you are unfamiliar with git, you should first get familiar with git and github. There are a number of resources available for learning git, but a good place to start is with the `github interactive tutorial <http://try.github.io/>`_. You should also get familiar with using pull requests and forks on github: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests _

To create and contribute a new tutorial, you will first need to fork the astropy-tutorials repository on github and clone this fork locally to your machine (replace <GITHUB USERNAME> with your github username)::

    git clone git@github.com:<GITHUB USERNAME>/astropy-tutorials.git

Next, create a branch in your local repository with the name of the tutorial you'd like to contribute. Let's imagine we're adding a tutorial to demonstrate spectral line fitting -- we might call it `Spectral-Line-Fitting`::

    git checkout -b Spectral-Line-Fitting

Next we'll create a new directory in `tutorials/` with the same name as the branch::

    mkdir tutorials/Spectral-Line-Fitting

All files used by the tutorial -- e.g., example data files, the iPython notebook file itself -- should go in this directory. Now you can start writing the tutorial! Simply change directories into this new path and start up an iPython notebook server::

    cd tutorials/Spectral-Line-Fitting
    ipython notebook --pylab=inline

Create a new notebook file, and write away! Remember to place any extra files used by the tutorial in the directory with the notebook file.

You will also need to create a tutorial metadata file in the same directory. The metadata file contains any extra information about the tutorial you may want to add and must be a `YAML <www.yaml.org>`_ file. YAML is a very simple, human readable markup language based on key-value pairs separater by a colon. This file must contain, at minimum, the following fields::

- author
- link_name (the name of the link which will appear in the list of tutorials)
- date (month year, e.g. 'July 2013')

An example of one of these files can be found `here <https://github.com/adrn/astropy-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/FITS-Header/metadata.yml>`_.

When you feel like your tutorial is complete, you will file a pull request against the main `astropy-tutorials` repository. You'll need to push this local branch up to your fork of the repository on github (by default, named 'origin')::

    git push origin Spectral-Line-Fitting
